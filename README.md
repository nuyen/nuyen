Lore
=========

The Nuyen (pronounced New Yen), symbol Â¥, is the currency of Japan and the primary monetary unit of international trade. It replaced the older Yen as Japan's currency on 1 June 2012 as part of the Yamato act.

On 2 August 2036, Japan granted policy control of the nuyen to the Zurich-Orbital Gemeinschaft Bank. Soon thereafter, the nuyen was established as the world accepted reserve currency.(SWA:54)

The Nuyen is accepted in virtually every country of the Sixth World and is the official currency of Australia, California, Denver, Japan, the Native American Nations, the Philippines, and Tir Tairngire.


FAQ

Another coin? : Yes, I wanted to make substancial wallet updates without forking anyone else's hardwork. Hopefully when complete other coins will borrow my code. Otherwise, hold on to your nuyen, because this is just the start of usability ideas.

How many coins?: 6.667 Trillion Nuyen will be minted. We arrived at this number, following the ShadowRun lore. 

"The nuyen has about the same buying power as a real life US dollar. This means that a good estimate for the cost of a basic item (clothes, meals, etc.) is a price in nuyen equal to the real world price in dollars."

According to the Japanese central bank, the M2 money supply plus CD balances totaled 700.3 trillion yen. (http://www.boj.or.jp/en/stat/stat_f.htm). Assuming an exchange rate of 104.89 yen per dollar, the Japanese money supply was $6.677 trillion USD at the time of calculation.
