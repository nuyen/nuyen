Lore
=========

The Nuyen (pronounced New Yen), symbol Â¥, is the currency of Japan and the primary monetary unit of international trade. It replaced the older Yen as Japan's currency on 1 June 2012 as part of the Yamato act.

On 2 August 2036, Japan granted policy control of the nuyen to the Zurich-Orbital Gemeinschaft Bank. Soon thereafter, the nuyen was established as the world accepted reserve currency.(SWA:54)

The Nuyen is accepted in virtually every country of the Sixth World and is the official currency of Australia, California, Denver, Japan, the Native American Nations, the Philippines, and Tir Tairngire.
